## Added
- The checkpoint HUD turns red when Kirby is able to spit. This is useful for practicing TAS spit (for double hits and quick boss kills, among other things).
- The default checkpoints file now has manipulation for King Dedede.

## Fixed
- The script no longer crashes if it is opened when a KDL ROM is not loaded.
